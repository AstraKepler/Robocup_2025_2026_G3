> *Winter is coming, and it’s time for the squirrels to stock up on hazelnuts so they can spend the whole winter in their soft, warm nests.</br> 
> But evil humans already took them all, put them in crates and are about to leave with them, and it will let squirrels starving for the next months!</br>
> Luckily it’s coffee time for the humans, and the squirrels have only few seconds to grab the hazelnut crates and hide it from the evil humans.</br>
> But will they have enough to pass the winter?*
>
> *Your strategies will be:*
> - *Let’s keep the hazelnuts warm.*
> - *To find is to keep!*
> - *Not too warm, not too cold.*
> - *Nest, sweet nest.*
> - *Lunch time!*
